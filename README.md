                  context,
                  isClosable: true,
                  backgroundColor: Colors.teal.shade500,
                  shadowColor: Colors.teal.shade200,
                  length: ToastLength.medium,
                  expandedHeight: 100,
                  message: "This is a message toast üëãüòé!",
                  messageStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
                  leading: const Icon(Icons.messenger),
                  slideCurve: Curves.elasticInOut,
                  positionCurve: Curves.bounceOut,
                  dismissDirection: DismissDirection.none,
                );
```

For widget toast - 

```dar
ToastService.showWidgetToast(
                  context,
                  isClosable: true,
                  backgroundColor: Colors.teal.shade500,
                  shadowColor: Colors.teal.shade200,
                  length: ToastLength.medium,
                  expandedHeight: 100,
                  leading: const Icon(Icons.messenger),
                  slideCurve: Curves.elasticInOut,
                  positionCurve: Curves.bounceOut,
                  dismissDirection: DismissDirection.none,
                  child: Container(
                  	color: Colors.blue,
                  	child: Center(
                  		child: Text('This is widget toast!'),
                  	),
                  ),
                );
```

Moreover, there are other 3 types of toast templates I've prepared for your need -

ToastService.showSuccessToast(
                  context,
                  length: ToastLength.medium,
                  expandedHeight: 100,
                  message: "This is a success toast ü•Ç!",
                );
```

```dart
ToastService.showWarningToast(
                  context,
                  length: ToastLength.medium,
                  expandedHeight: 100,
                  message: "This is a warning toast!",
                );
```
